# Automatic Logistic Chests

Automatically configures item requests and inserter conditions for logistic chests, including passive provider, active provider, storage, requester, and buffer chests.

## How It Works

1. **Place a Crafting Machine**: Start by placing a crafting machine, such as an assembling machine or furnace, and select a valid recipe.
2. **Set Up Inserters**: Connect the machine with inserters for both input and output as required.
3. **Add Logistic Chests**: Place the appropriate logistic chests (e.g., requester, provider, storage, or buffer). The mod automatically configures chests only at their initial placement if the machine and inserters are already set up.
4. **Refresh Chests Manually as Needed**: Use the manual refresh shortcuts to update chest requests or clear unused filters when necessary.

## Logistic Chest Behavior

- **Passive and Active Provider Chests**: Configures inserter logistic network conditions to supply items when required.
- **Storage Chests**: Sets inserter logistic network conditions and applies a storage filter on the chest.
- **Requester Chests**: Automatically adds item requests based on the crafting machine's requirements.
- **Buffer Chests**: Configures both item requests and inserter logistic network conditions based on the setup's needs.

## FAQ

### Why doesnâ€™t the mod automatically update requests when recipes are removed or changed?

The mod is designed to minimize complexity and resource usage. It does not actively monitor dynamic changes such as recipe updates. For such cases, use the provided manual refresh controls.

### How do I clear requests when removing a recipe?

Use the **Refresh Selected Logistic Chest** shortcut to manually clear outdated requests and reset the chest configuration. Alternatively, use the **Refresh All Logistic Chests** shortcut to update all chests.

### Can this mod handle dynamic setups?

This mod is best suited for static setups like malls or predefined blueprints. While it can handle dynamic environments with manual refreshes, automated functionality for such cases is not within its intended scope.
