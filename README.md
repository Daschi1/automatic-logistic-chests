# Automatic logistic chests
## Automatically configures provider and requester chests.

When a logistical chest gets placed, the mod figures out, which inserters insert / extract from valid crafting machines. According to the ingredients and products, a logistic request or inserter condition is set.

This mod is inspired by the [AutomaticLogisticChest](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/AutomaticLogisticChest) mod from [Hideaki](https://mods.factorio.com/user/Hideaki).
